*A REST API client in Java is used to send HTTP requests to a RESTful web service (server) and handle responses. This client typically makes requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and processes the data returned by the server. The response is usually in the form of JSON or XML format, but JSON is by far the most common format for data exchange in modern APIs.
A REST API client in Java helps your application to interact with RESTful services, enabling functionalities like fetching data from a web service, sending data to a server, and updating information based on the serverâ€™s responses. Java provides several libraries to handle HTTP requests and parse JSON responses efficiently.A REST API client in Java is an essential component for building applications that need to interact with web services. With the help of libraries like HttpClient, Apache HttpClient, OkHttp, and Gson/Jackson, Java developers can send HTTP requests, parse JSON responses, and process the data efficiently. This functionality is widely used in cloud computing, microservices, mobile applications, and external service integrations.*
